# Horiseon Challenge

## Motivation

This page exists to demonstrate refactoring and consolidating abilities. A strong motive for refactoring and consolidating this site was to improve the accessibility of the site for those with disabilities who use assistive technologies such as screen readers, video captions, and braille keyboards. Accessible sites also rank higher in search engines which is another motivation for this refactoring and consolidating.

## Description

This page is a mock-up website for a marketing agency that has requested their code to be refactored in order to make the site more accessible. 

## Installation
